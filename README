#OptOut

This respository holds the iPython Notebooks that I wrote for the OptOut project.  In this project in collaboration with Professor Alexandra Killewald, we identify common patterns of maternal employment of American mothers in the first 18 years of maternity and examine which demographic, economic, and cultural factors are associated with each maternal employment pattern.
