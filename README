# OptOut
# 12/11/2017

This respository holds the Python scripts that I wrote to create datasets for the OptOut project. This project is in collaboration with Professor Alexandra Killewald, in which we use sequence analysis (specifically optimal matching) and multinomial logit regression to identify common patterns of maternal employment of American mothers and key pre-birth characteristics associated with each pattern.
